# LLM Engineering Projects

Welcome to the LLM Engineering project repository! 
This project focuses on the development and implementation of cutting-edge Large Language Models for various applications. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this repository provides tools, scripts, and resources to help you work with state-of-the-art language models effectively.

## Introduction

This repository contains code, documentation, and relevant resources for building and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The project aims to explore advanced NLP techniques and experiment with various LLM architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance. It includes tools for:

    . Preprocessing and cleaning datasets.

    . Fine-tuning LLMs on custom datasets.

    . Evaluating model performance.

    . Deploying models for inference in production environments.

## Features

    . Datasets: Preprocessed datasets and utilities for dataset management. 
    
    . Preprocessing Tools: Clean and prepare datasets for training and fine-tuning.
    
    . Model Training: Training scripts for various LLM architectures.

    . Fine-tuning: Tools and techniques for fine-tuning LLMs on specific tasks. Fine-tuning is a key aspect of adapting LLMs to specific tasks. This repository supports fine-tuning with:
          . Hugging Face Transformers
          . LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
          . PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
          
    . Inference: Efficient inference pipelines for real-time and batch processing.

    . Evaluation: Benchmarking and evaluation metrics for model performance with standard NLP metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity).

    . Deployment Templates: Deploy models using APIs, Docker, or serverless architectures.

    . Modular Design: Extend and customize the pipeline for your specific needs.

## Installation

  To get started, clone this repository and set up the environment:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm_engineering.git
  cd llm_engineering

## Prerequisites

    . Python 3.8 or higher - This project uses Python 3.11

    . PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model)

    . Hugging Face Transformers library

    . Ollama (for local model management)

    . DeepSeek API key (for API integration)

    . Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Set up

     . Create a virtual environment
   
     . Install dependencies
   
   Set up Ollama (if not already installed):
   
    . Follow the installation instructions from the Ollama documentation (https://ollama.com/download/)

    . Download and configure the desired models using Ollama CLI.

Set up DeepSeek API:

    . Obtain your API key from the DeepSeek platform.

    . Add the API key to your environment variables

## Deployment

   Deploy your fine-tuned model using:

    . FastAPI for REST APIs

    . Docker for containerized deployment

    . Serverless frameworks like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions

  DeepSeek API Integration

  This repository includes integration with the DeepSeek API for advanced LLM capabilities. To use DeepSeek:

  Set your API key as an environment variable:
  bash : export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
  Refer to the docs/deepseek_integration.md for more details.

   Ollama Integration

  Ollama is used for managing and running local models efficiently. To use Ollama:
